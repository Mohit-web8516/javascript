****************Asynchronous Code in JavaScript***********


JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes one line at a time in order. Normally, this is synchronous: each statement must finish before the next one runs. But in real-world applications, tasks like fetching data from a server, reading files, or waiting for user input can take time.


******************************************

Execution Context
An execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

Types:

Global Execution Context (GEC) → Created when the script first runs. It contains global objects (window in browsers) and variables.

Function Execution Context (FEC) → Created whenever a function is invoked. Each function call gets its own context.

Each context has:

Variable Environment → Stores variables and function declarations.

Scope Chain → Determines variable accessibility.

this Binding → Defines the value of this inside that context.

****************************************************


Call Stack
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) manner.

When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the stack.

***************************************************************

Memory Heap
The memory heap is where objects and reference types (arrays, functions, objects) are stored.

Unlike the stack (which is structured), the heap is a large, mostly unstructured region of memory.

Primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans) are stored directly in the stack, while objects are stored in the heap with references kept in the stack.


********************************************************

Blocking Code
Definition: Code that stops further execution until the current task is finished.

Effect: The program cannot do anything else while waiting.


********************************************************

Non-Blocking Code
Definition: Code that initiates a task and allows other operations to continue while waiting for the result.

Effect: Keeps applications responsive, especially for I/O operations (network requests, file reads).
